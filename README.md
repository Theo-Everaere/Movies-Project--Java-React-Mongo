Project description:

This is a movie website that allows users to display a carousel of movies, watch movie trailers, and add/read user reviews.

The website is built using React for the front-end, Java for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

The development environment for this project includes Visual Studio Code for React and IntelliJ IDEA for Java.

To run the website, you need to connect to MongoDB (e.g., Atlas), start the back-end, and then launch the front-end using npm start.
